🚗🔋 Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Analysis & Dashboard

🔍 Project Overview
This project features an end-to-end Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Analysis and Dashboard, completed during my Data Research internship at Unified Mentor. The objective was to analyze India’s electric vehicle sales trends (2015–2020) and deliver actionable, data-driven insights using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

🚨 The Problem
India is rapidly transitioning to electric mobility, but key stakeholders—manufacturers, policymakers, and investors—often lack clear visibility into sales performance across different vehicle segments and regions. Understanding where demand is surging and which categories are driving adoption is critical for capitalizing on this market shift and aligning future resources.

🛠️ Tools & Methodology

Python (Pandas, NumPy): Cleaned, preprocessed, and prepared raw datasets for exploratory data analysis.

SQL: Queried and segmented structured data to uncover baseline market trends.

Excel: Performed initial data validation, aggregations, and pivot table analysis for quick verification.

Power BI: Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize vehicle category performance, regional adoption patterns, and year-over-year (YoY) growth with seasonal demand analysis.

✅ Key Insights & Business Impact

Mass Market Dominance: 2-Wheelers lead adoption with a ~50% market share (~1.8M units), highlighting massive consumer demand for low-cost, personal EVs.

Shared Mobility Surge: 3-Wheelers account for ~45% of total sales, underscoring the rapid electrification of urban shared mobility and last-mile delivery.

Untapped Potential: 4-Wheelers and heavy public transport vehicles remain under-penetrated, presenting a significant white-space opportunity for future corporate investment.

Regional Hotspots: Adoption is heavily concentrated in five top-performing states: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, and Rajasthan.

Growth Patterns: The analysis revealed consistent year-over-year market expansion alongside clearly identifiable seasonal demand peaks.

📌 Key Takeaways
This project provided practical, hands-on experience in executing a complete data analytics lifecycle—from raw data extraction and transformation using Python and SQL to developing strategic, stakeholder-ready business visualizations in Power BI.
